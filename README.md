This is a UWP aplication, I have installed it in my windows 10, not sure if it works on other versions.
To install it, first you have to install the digital certificate, to do that follow this instructions:

1. Open the .cer file
2. Cilc on Install Certificate
3. Select Local PC.
4. Give administrator permission.
5. Select Put every certificates in the next...
6. Clic in Examine...
7. Select Trust certification entities
8. Accept.

Then you can install the app by runing the .msixbundle file.

Hope you enyoi it, I have worked a lot to keep things as simple as posible, so I hope you can discover the functionalities of the app by yourself.
Actually im working on a tutorial, for now I hope you can handle it ‚ù§.
